# Trade-off decisions
In the initial model, we thought that if we had member table and ride table, we would be able to load the reserved data, but if we didn't create a separate table, we would have to create a table that uses the time table ID as the key value.

# Challenges
We didn't define and start specific details with team members who shared the same table, DTO, and DAO, resulting in a number of revisions each time we shared the interim results.
